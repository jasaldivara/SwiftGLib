A Swift wrapper around glib-2.x that is largely auto-generated from gobject-introspection.

## Overview

SwiftGLib allows you to use the low-level GLib library directly from Swift
without having to resort to using the low-level C interface.
GLib has been in development for many years and is used by numerous open source
programs and libraries including [Gtk](https://github.com/rhx/SwiftGtk).
GLib is particularly useful for organising low-level data by providing abstractions
for data structures, containers, and collections that can directly be used by C code
as well as Swift.
